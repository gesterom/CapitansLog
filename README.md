# Capitan's Log

A mod for Sailwind that periodically records the player's location for later use on https://moffkalast.github.io/Sailwind-Map/. It helps players better understand where they got lost or how far off their navigation was when using in-game instruments.

This mod requires BepInEx as the mod loader.
